            <strong>Aims of the Project:</strong> The aim of this study is to develop 
            a file storage system that employs hybrid cryptography to 
            enhance the security and efficiency of data storage. .<br /><br />
            <strong>Methodology:</strong>
          </p>
          <ol class="mb-5 list-decimal">
            <li>The research design for this study is structured to include both theoretical and practical components. 
              The design process involves several stages, including system requirements analysis, 
              cryptographic model design, system architecture development, prototype implementation, 
              and system evaluation. Each stage is integral to ensuring that the final system meets 
              the desired security and performance standards.</li>
            <li>
              Firstly, the system requirements analysis phase involves gathering detailed requirements 
              from potential users and stakeholders to ensure the system addresses their needs. 
              This phase includes the identification of functional and non-functional requirements, 
              which serve as the foundation for the subsequent design and development stages.
            </li>
            <li>
              Next, the cryptographic model design phase involves selecting and designing the appropriate 
              cryptographic algorithms that form the backbone of the system security architecture. 
              This phase includes theoretical research on various cryptographic techniques to ensure 
              the chosen algorithms provide robust security and efficiency.
            </li>
            <li>
              The system architecture development phase focuses on creating a detailed blueprint of the system, 
              outlining the interactions between different components and layers. This phase ensures 
              that the system is designed with scalability, maintainability, and security in mind.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>Final</p>
          <br />
          <ol class="mb-10 list-decimal">
            <li>
              Following the design phases, the prototype implementation phase involves translating 
              the design into a working prototype. This includes coding, integrating different modules, 
              and conducting preliminary testing to ensure the system functions as intended.
            </li>
            <li>Finally, the system evaluation phase involves rigorous testing and analysis 
              to assess the system performance, security, and usability. This phase includes 
              both qualitative and quantitative evaluations to provide a comprehensive understanding 
              of the system strengths and areas for improvement.</li>
